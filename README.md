# Caeser-v1.0
Caeser chess engine
As a part of the full project CheckMate chess ecosystem, here's the most valuable part Caeser chess engine.

The engine requires Arena (3.4 or later) to run in UI mode.

You can run Caeser in console mode for debugging.

This engine comes with two protocols: UCI and winboard.

UCI has shown some errors in this version, it's better to run on winboard mode.
